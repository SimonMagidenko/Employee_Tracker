## Description

This project was built to allow a company to accurately input and sort their company data into a database. This fixes the problem of formatting and creating tables using mySQL, since I have done that for the user. Users are able to view all sorts of criteria, alongside having the ability to update and delete data. This project consisted of primarily Javascript, mySQL, nodeJS, expressJS, and inquirer. I was able to strengthen my skills in these languages and frameworks while creating this Employee Tracker.
